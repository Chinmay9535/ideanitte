Flaws and Potential Issues:

Performance Issues:
Translation cache might grow unbounded (no cache size limit)
No pagination for search history
Large amounts of client-side processing for translations
Error Handling:
Some error messages exposed to client (could leak system information)
Inconsistent error handling patterns
Some catch blocks return original text without notifying user of failure

Code Structure:
Mixed concerns in server.js (routes, models, and middleware in same file)
Large script.js file with multiple responsibilities
Lack of modular architecture
No clear separation of concerns
API Design:
No versioning for API endpoints
Inconsistent response formats
No API documentation
No request validation middleware
Frontend Issues:
Heavy reliance on client-side processing
No loading states shown for async operations
Potential memory leaks in event listeners
No proper error boundaries
Environmental Variables:
Some hardcoded fallback values
No clear configuration management
Missing essential environment variables validation

UX Considerations:
No offline support
No progressive enhancement
No accessibility considerations visible
No responsive design patterns shown
